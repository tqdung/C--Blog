Starting the plan, Review all my C++ knowleged

Class String
Different between cin >> variable and getline(cin, variable): Cin >> will passing all charactor that you input into variable but, if it have
"place space", all charactor after "place space" will waiting for the next extraction

Example:
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter your full name: ";
    std::string name;
    std::cin >> name; // this won't work as expected since std::cin breaks on whitespace
 
    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";
    std::string age;
    std::cin >> age;
 
    std::cout << "Your name is " << name << " and your age is " << age;
}
output will: 
Enter your full name: John Doe
Enter your age: Your name is John and your age is Doe
